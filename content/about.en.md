      text: |
        At the Ishikawa Lab, we aim to understand interactions and learn from field diversity, striving to create mechanisms that enable everyone to achieve well-being through co-creation with diverse people.

        We conduct research to understand how the human mind works in relationships between people and technology, working towards a society where everyone can enjoy well-being through the power of computer science. In particular, we focus on developing mechanisms that assist in achieving goals in human-human and human-machine interactions, creating systems that help everyone in a given situation achieve well-being.

        Through our research, we aim to create the following values:
        - Supporting vibrant lifestyles for maximizing individual well-being
        - Co-creation with stakeholders in diverse inclusive societies
        - Realizing new forms of human-machine collaboration through technology

      title: Lab Characteristics
      text: |
        In our laboratory, we value the following research design and culture:

        ### Research Design
        - **Representation and Understanding of Mind (Basic Research)**: Research to understand how the human mind works using multimodal interactions as cues
        - **Development and Evaluation of Human-Machine Interactions (Applied Research)**: Technology development and evaluation for neurominorities

        ### Lab Culture
        - **Thought Endurance**: Encouraging continuous thinking about themes rather than seeking immediate answers
        - **Immersion into the Field**: Valuing the ability to thoroughly model phenomena and develop them as computer science problems
        - **Innovation Mind**: Fostering the ability to discover goals and tackle challenges proactively
        - **A Place for Self-Transformation**: Creating an environment where team members can cooperatively and empathetically engage with each other, constantly updating themselves without fear of failure
