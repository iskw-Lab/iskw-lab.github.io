abstract: In the field of full-endoscopic spine surgery, two-dimensional images from CT and other scans are used to explain the patient's condition and surgical procedure to the patient, which is difficult for the patient to understand. In this study, in collaboration with Iwai Orthopaedic Hospital, we aim to reduce patient anxiety and improve understanding through patient explanation using VR.
