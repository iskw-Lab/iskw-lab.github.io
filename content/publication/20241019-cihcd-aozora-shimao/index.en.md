abstract: Patient explanation in spine surgery requires high expertise, and it is difficult for patients to understand using only 2D images such as CT and MRI. In this presentation, we present the concept of content that improves understanding through VR content and addresses patients' anxieties and questions in collaboration with Iwai Orthopedic Hospital.
