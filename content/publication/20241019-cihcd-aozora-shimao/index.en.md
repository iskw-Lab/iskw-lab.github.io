abstract: In the field of full-endoscopic spine surgery, two-dimensional images from CT and other scans are used to explain the patient's condition and surgical procedure, which is difficult for patients to understand. In collaboration with Iwai Orthopedic Hospital, this study aims to reduce patient anxiety and improve understanding through VR-based patient explanation. The development of VR content is expected to contribute to improving the patient experience.
