abstract: Because the relationship between the manifestations of symptoms and causes of dementia is diverse, skills to understand the cognitive perspectives of people with dementia are important, and the experiential images of the narratives need to be supplemented. In this study, we constructed a PX experience platform that enables users to experience the patient experience (PX) in VR based on the narratives of people with dementia, and investigated the usefulness of this platform. This platform enables the user to experience various cognitive impairments from a first-person perspective, control the impairments and environment, and share the space with many people, enabling the user to experience cognitive activities while comparing them with healthy people. As a result of using the system for the general public, it was suggested that sharing the experience with other learners may lead to a better understanding of dementia, and that the experience by people with dementia may deepen their understanding of cognitive activities.
