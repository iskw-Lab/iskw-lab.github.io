abstract: While the number of people with dementia is increasing due to the aging of the population, there is a shortage of care professionals, and effective human resource education is needed. understanding the PX (patient experience) fosters cognitive empathy and leads to high-quality care.The purpose of this study was to construct an environment for co-production VR spaces in which PX can be experienced with people with dementia, and through the experience of spaces by two people with dementia with Lewy bodies, it was suggested that this would lead to the construction of an appropriate PX space.
