abstract: For student safety and hygiene education, we developed an immersive VR content that allows users to experience the atmosphere and hazards of a chemistry laboratory at close range, with the cooperation of the Mase-Narumi Laboratory at Shizuoka University. Unlike last year's objective video, we incorporated a first-person perspective, such as inside the chemistry laboratory draft chamber, and created content that allows users to observe experiments as a member of the laboratory, pursuing the realism of experiments. This presentation introduces the design concept of this educational material and provides a demonstration.
