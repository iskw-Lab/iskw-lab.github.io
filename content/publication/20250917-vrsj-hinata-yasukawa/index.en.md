abstract: In care settings, highly individualized practices are required that respond to the conditions and contexts of care recipients. This study develops VR simulation education for training practical caring with avatars in VR spaces. To provide practical training experiences, we propose an environment that eliminates extraordinary guiding elements and enables learners to engage in critical thinking.
