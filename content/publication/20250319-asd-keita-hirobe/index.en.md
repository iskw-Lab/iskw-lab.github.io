abstract: Since the relationship between the manifested symptoms and their causes is diverse in dementia, it is important to have skills to understand the cognitive perspectives of people with dementia and to complement the experiential images of the narratives. In this study, we constructed an immersive patient experience (PX) platform that enables the PX to be experienced in VR through co-design with individuals living with dementia. The platform enables the user to experience various symptoms of dementia from a first-person perspective, as well as to control obstacles and the environment, and to share the space with many people, making it possible to experience cognitive activities. As a result of conducting the PX experience for people with dementia, it was confirmed that the co-design process functions, suggesting the possibility of an experience that is closer to the perspective of the individuals living with dementia.
