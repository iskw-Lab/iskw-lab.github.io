abstract: This paper describes the results of an analysis of the transformation of staff care skills and the characteristics of instructional interactions based on practical data collected in a medical care facility where an all-participant video coaching environment was introduced and the entire organization worked to continuously improve skills in dementia care. Dementia care requires advanced skills that are difficult to acquire, such as the ability to judge the situation according to the condition of a patient, in addition to the physical ability to practice care skills. To acquire such advanced skills, continuous practice and coaching interventions are required; however, face-to-face interventions are limited in time and space. This video coaching environment solves these problems by replacing the conventional face-to-face instructional interactions with video coaching using videos of care practices. We conducted seven cases of learning based on this learning environment in a chronic care hospital and analyzed the effects of video coaching on care skills and the characteristics of instructional interactions. The results showed that the video coaching improved the dementia care skills and revealed the educational effect of the video coaching. In addition, we found that the practical data of instructional interaction revealed the characteristics of expert instruction and the effect of sharing the instructional skills throughout an organization.

summary: We published an original paper in the Journal of Information Processing. # 正式名称に変更
