abstract: This presentation outlines the concept for upcoming research. While ESG and sustainability emphasis is advancing in US companies, there are challenges in quantitative evaluation. Impact investment emphasizes social and environmental outcomes in addition to economic benefits, but obstacles include insufficient indicators and conflicts with short-term profits. The research aims to visualize impact using information science, construct indicators and create empathy, contributing to the realization of a sustainable society.
