        - **AI Technology for Supporting People with Disabilities and Caregivers**: Developing and evaluating self-care support systems using AI technology to accompany people with disabilities and promote recovery, as well as care support systems to improve caregivers' skills
        - **Narrative Understanding and Co-creation**: Developing technologies to understand narratives of stakeholders in diverse inclusive societies and conducting practical research to create mechanisms for better living together with stakeholders
        - **XR Technology for Mental Understanding and Social Practice**: Developing PX (Patient eXperience) experience platforms using VR and metaverse technology to recreate the experiential world of people with disabilities in virtual space and verifying the effects of experience expansion
